*These pumpkin muffins* are full of autumnal spices and to make it even more seasonal I used some chestnut flour. Chestnuts have a lightly sweet and nutty taste and that blends in very well with the other ingredients.

### Ingredients

The following turns into 12 vegan muffins.

#### Dry ingredients
* 140g whole spelt flour (aka "dinkel wheat")
* 100g chestnut flour (OR more whole spelt flour)
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 table spoon cinnamon
* ⅓ teaspoon nutmeg
* ¼ teaspoon cardamon
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 80g Xylitol (Or use Stevia, crane sugar or other preferred sweetener)

#### Additional ingredients
* 220g pure pumpkin puree
* 200g plant milk (almond OR rice OR soy milk)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon grated ginger
* ~2 teaspoons egg replacer (according to directions the amount for 2 eggs)
* mixed with water according to directions)

#### Decoration
* sliced almonds (OR other nuts or seeds)


### Let’s start
First prepare the pumpkin puree. Cut the pumpkin in small pieces and peel. Cook until tender. Alternatively you can cut the whole pumpkin in half and bake in the oven till tender. Turn into puree using a blender and press the needed amount through a sieve.

Alternatively you can sometimes find pure pumpkin puree in the supermarket, but I love to cook with it and prefer therefore to make it on my own. I prepared puree from half a pumpkin and turned the rest into a soup.


### Finish up
Preheat your oven to 180°C and prepare a muffin tray with paper cups.

Whisk all the dried ingredients in a big bowl.
In a separate bowl mix all the other ingredients together. Stir this wet mixture into the first bowl.

Fill the batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups. 

Bake in the oven at **180°C 20-25 minutes**. 

I added the almond decoration after about five minutes. Otherwise they probably would have sunken in the batter.
Ready when a needle (e.g. a toothpick) remains dry after dipping it in the middle of a cake.

Let cool down and enjoy.
