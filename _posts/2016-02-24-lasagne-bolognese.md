0. Grind the nutrional yeast flakes with the back of a spoon till fine. 
0. Stir the yeast into four tablespoon of our Béchamel Sauce. Add the ground almonds and oat cream. Adjust the amount of almonds when using milk instead of cream. We aim for a creamy but not too thick consistency.
0. Season with salt and thyme.



### Assemble

Preheat the oven to 180°C (~360°F).

Time to assemble all together into a wonderful lasagne. Either choose one small casserole or baking pan per person or make one large one to share.

0. Start with spreading some béchamel sauce
1. Place a layer of pasta sheets
2. Cover with bolognese

Continue alternating the layers till almost reached the top of the dish.
Finish with a layer of bolognese and cover it with our cheesy topping.

The pasta doesn't need to be pre-cooked since lasagne is baked in the oven long enough. Just ensure that no pasta sheets are sticking out of the sauce and all is well covered to ensure the pasta to get cooked.

0. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
1. Remove the cover and bake for another 20 minutes.
