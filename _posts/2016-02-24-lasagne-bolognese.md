0. Add approximately two table spoons of olive oil to a heated pan. Sauté half an onion, then add the chopped garlic and grated carrot. Wait until onions turn translucent.

0. Add the minced tofu and continue to fry. Fry until all is starting to brown.

0. Deglaze with red wine, then add the tomatoes.

0. Add water - you can rinse the tomato bottle/can to get all the tomato goodness into your sauce.

0. Bring the sauce to a boil, then turn down the heat and let simmer for 15 minutes. Adjust with water if it becomes too thick.

0. Season with rosemary, salt and pepper

0. Grind the nutrional yeast flakes with the back of a spoon until fine. 
0. Stir the yeast into four tablespoons of our Béchamel sauce. Add the ground almonds and oat cream. Adjust the amount of almonds when using milk instead of cream. We aim for a creamy but not too thick consistency.
0. Season with salt and thyme.



### Assemble

Preheat the oven to 180°C (~360°F).

Time to assemble all together into a wonderful lasagne. Either choose one small casserole or baking pan per person or make one large one to share.

0. Start with spreading some Béchamel sauce
1. Place a layer of pasta sheets
2. Cover with bolognese

Continue alternating the layers. Finish with a layer of bolognese and cover it with our cheesy topping.

Ensure that no pasta sheets are sticking out of the sauce and all are well covered to ensure the pasta to get cooked. This way the pasta does not need to be pre-cooked.  

0. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
1. Remove the cover and bake for another 20 minutes.
