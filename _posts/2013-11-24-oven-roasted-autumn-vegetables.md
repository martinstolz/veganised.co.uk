*This weekend it’s all about pumpkin!* The first half of the big pumpkin we bought contributes to this delicious low-carb dinner. Pumpkin goes very well with the fresh and fruity tastes of Brussels sprouts and pomegranate. In addition the autumnal colours look really lovely and make it even more enjoyable.

### Ingredients

Serves 2
#### Vegetables
* 3 hands full of brussels sprouts
* ½ pumpkin
* 1 red onion
* ½ pomegranate

#### Seasoning
* salt
* pepper
* olive Oil
* chilli flakes
* rosemary

### Let’s start
Grab a knife and
* Cut the onion in small pieces.
* Cut the pumpkin in cubes and depending on the kind cut off the peel
* Peel of dry outer leaves of the brussels sprouts and cut off the stem and then cut in half.

### Roasting
Place all those ingredients inside a big baking tray and mix with olive oil and spices.
Bake in the oven at **200°C for about 35 minutes** or till the pumpkin is soft and turn over from time to time to give the vegetables a nice crispy brown look from all sides.

### Finish up
Cut the pomegranate in half and place a half upside down in your hand holding it over the prepared dish. 
Pound with the other hand from the top, best using a big wooden cooking spoon and let this way the seeds trickle through your fingers on top of the veggies.
