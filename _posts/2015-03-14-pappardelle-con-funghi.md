*Our turn on one of our favourite Italian dishes*, pasta with Mushrooms. We recommend to serve it with broad, flat pasta like Pappardelle or Tagliatelle. The broad surface allows our chunky sauce to hold onto. 
The use of [plant cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_cream) is an easy way to veganise many beloved creamy dishes.

### Ingredients
![The ingredients](/public/assets/pappardelle-con-funghi-ingredients.jpg "The ingredients")

Serves 2
#### Pasta
* egg-free pasta of your choice
* salted water

#### Creamy sauce
* vegetable oil
* 1 onion
* 1 clove garlic
* 3 cups wild mushrooms
* oat or rice cream
* 1 cup parsley
* half cup terragon
* salt and pepper
* chilli

### Preparation
If your chosen pasta has a very short cooking time, for example using fresh one, you should start to prepare the sauce as well before starting to cook the pasta.

* Chop the onion in small cubes
* Clean brush the mushrooms and cut in small pieces
* Finely chop the parsley and terragon

### The Pasta
First bring the salted water to a boil. 
Let the pasta cook according to the timing provided on the packaging. Keep checking to not miss the perfect point of them being "al dente". This means the noodles are cooked, but still firm to the bite and not too soft. Keep some of the pasta water.

### The Sauce
While cooking the pasta prepare the sauce. 

* Add the oil into a pan and set heat to medium. Add a piece of onion to the pan. As soon as you hear a sizzling the wanted temperature is reached
* Sautée the onion till it starts to turn transparent. Add the garlic and let it sautée for one minute longer
* Add the mushrooms and chilli to the pan and let everything sautee
* Once the mushrooms are tender add a good squeeze of cream to deglaze
* Add a few tablespoons of pasta water to improve the taste and texture of the sauce. Wait and let the sauce thicken until the wanted consistency is reached
* Add most of the parsley and all of the terragon and season with salt and pepper to taste


### Wrapping up
For authentic italian styled pasta you want to add the pasta to the finished sauce and mix everything in the sauce pan before arranging it on a warm plate.

Add parsley for garnish.

### Choosing the ingredients
The taste of the [oat cream](http://www.oatly.com/) goes very well with the mushrooms but other plant based creams would work just as good.

### Here the nutrient facts, what have we won by veganising that dish.

Leaving off the dairy cream in the dish no hormones, no puss and no antibiotics in your body. Without the probably pasteurised cow's milk you absorb more calcium than in the non vegan dish. The acidic acting cow milk depletes calcium from your bones. Research the myth about milk being one of the best calcium sources if that is new to you.
