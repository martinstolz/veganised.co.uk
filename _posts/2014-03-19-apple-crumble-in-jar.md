*This sweet healthy treat is inspired by the gü desserts.* One can get them in various flavours. They look totally cute the way they are layered in their glass jars. Unfortunatly they didn't think as far as to provide some vegan variations as well... Here comes a homemade guilt-free variation! Prepare a couple in advance and enjoy bringing a great snack to work.

The recipe is originally for [Caramel Crumble Raw Apple Pie](http://www.rawlau.com/2013/03/08/caramel-crumble-raw-apple-pie-recipe/) by the amazing [Raw Lauren](http://www.rawlau.com/about/). She has a lot of wonderful raw recipes, so have a look around and get inspired for more.

The recipe is not the quickest to make with it's five different components. But I found the effort was really well worth it, when tasting the result.


### Ingredients

The ingredients amount from the cake recipe worked perfect for 10 small jars.

#### Crust
* 1 cup raw walnuts
* ½ cup dates
* ½ teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ginger


#### Filling: Layer 1 (Apple sauce)
* 1 apple
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon psyllium
* pinch of cinnamon
* pinch of salt


#### Filling: Layer 2 (Spiced apples)
* 2 apples
* 1 tablespoon lemon
* 1 teaspoon psyillium
* ¾ teaspoon cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg
* ¼ teaspoon ginger
* ¼ teaspoon allspice


#### Crumble
* ¼ cup raw walnuts
* ⅛ cup raw almonds
* ⅛ cup raw macadamia nuts
* ⅓ cup raisins
* ¼ teaspoon ginger
* ¼ teaspoon cinnamon


#### Caramel Sauce
* ¼ cup soaked dates (start soaking when you make the crust)
* 1-2 tablespoon soaking water
* 1 tablespoon almond butter
* 1 teaspoon lemon
* pinch salt
* pinch vanilla powder


### Prepare the crust
* Add walnuts to food processor and ground into a fine meal.
* Add spices and dates a few at a time to food processor.
* Transfer mixture to the jars and press to form a thin crust in each of them.


### Prepare layer 1
* Peel and core the apple.
* Place all ingredients to food processor and process into a sauce.
* Pour into jars on top of the crust and spread evenly with back of a spoon.


### Prepare layer 2
* Peel and core the apples. Thinly slice into half-moons and place in a bowl (big enough to allow some mixing).
* Add all remaining ingredients to the bowl and combine (using your fingers or tossing). The apples should be coated with the spices.
* Layer the apples evenly over layer 1.


### Prepare Crumble
* Add all ingredients to the food processor and pulse a few times to get crumbles.
* Sprinkle on top of layer 2.


### Prepare Caramel Sauce
* Add all ingredients to the food processor and process until smooth sauce. Start with one tablespoon of water.
* Add more of the soaking water as necessary. The resulting sauce consistency should still be thick, but easy spreadable.
* Either place the sauce with the help of a spoon. Or use a piping bag to add more kind of patteerns on top of the pies.


### Note
All amounts are given in cups, which I didn’t mind since I got measurement cups as a xmas present. But since this turned out to be such a tasty treat I’m sure I’ll prepare it again and can then provide a metric version.


The instructions call for a food processor. Currently not having one, I used a blender instead. That worked, but took some more time, because the amounts are quite small. Also I had to take it apart after each layer to get everything out.


About the jars: I filled 10 small ones, but a few more or less are fine – depending on desired portion size. To have the cakes portable use jars with a lid. Small plastic food storage containers will look less stylish, but work fine as well.
