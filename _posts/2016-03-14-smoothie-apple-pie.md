### Ingredients

Serves 2

* 1½ cup water
* ⅓ cup oats
* ½ cup almonds (soaked overnight)
* 1 Tbs chia seeds
* ⅓ cup raisins
* 2-3 apples 
* Cinnamon to taste
* Pinch of salt
* 3-5 ice cubes


### Preparation and tipps


* Blend all ingredients till smooth using a high speed blender like a Vitamix for best results.
* Add the ice cubes as needed to keep the smoothie from warming up while blending. This depends on your blender. Instead you could also add a few chunks frozen banana if at hand.
* When working with almonds it is advisable to soak them overnight. This makes them easier to digest and allows to body to absorb more of their nutrients.
* If you have a selection of apples to choose from, go for juicy and sweet flavoured ones. This is also a great way to use up apples that already are a bit older and start to wrinkle.
