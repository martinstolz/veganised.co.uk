*Squashs come in all kind of shapes and are very versatile.* This recipe is an easy to make take on creating the Amercian classic Mac'n'Cheese.

<!--more-->

We used a Yellow Pattypan Squash, but other variants will most likely work as well. In case you wonder: pumpkin is one type of squash as well.

Any pasta type with a hole like Macaroni is great for this dish since the creamy sauce will fill the pasta. We found some shaped like a spiral corkscrew called Stortarelli or Spirali.

### Ingredients

Serves 2


#### Pasta

* Macaroni shaped egg-free pasta
* Salted water


#### Cheesy sauce

* 1 small squash
* 500 ml oat milk or unsweetened plain almond milk
* 3-4 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1-2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch
* Sea Salt


#### Topping

* Oil for frying i.e. coconut oil
* 1 red onion
* Black pepper


### Preparation

Have your squash in the oven before you start cooking the pasta. Best timing allows to add the pasta directly to the ready sauce. Otherwise pasta can become sticky till ready to serve.


#### Squash

0. Preheat the oven to **180Â°C**.
1. Cut the squash in chunks, remove the seeds, but do not peel yet.
2. Toss the squash with some oil and spread on a bakin sheet.
3. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes or till the squash is soft.

### Let's start


#### Cheesy sauce

0. Get the squash out of the oven and let it cool down a few minutes
1. Put all other ingredients for the sauce already in your blender (starting with just a little salt)
2. Peel the squash chunks and place the flesh in the blender as well. You might be able to scrab it off with just a spoon
3. Blend everything together till smooth
4. Season with more salt to taste if needed


#### Pasta

0. Bring salted water to a boil.
1. Cook pasta according to the timing provided on the packaging.
2. Keep some of the pasta water when done in case the cheesy sauce feels too thick
3. Toss the pasta in the sauce and keep it warm in a pot


#### Topping
0. Slice the red onion in rings
1. Heat a pan with some oil and fry the onion till starting to brown


### Assemble

* Serve the pasta topped with the fried onion rings and fresh ground black pepper.




**Enjoy!**
