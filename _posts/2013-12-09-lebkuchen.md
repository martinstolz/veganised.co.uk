*Advent is here.* Time for pre-christmas preparation, listening to Christmas carols and find time for reflectiveness. Being German, this also includes baking special cookies (called "Plätzchen").

This year I decided to bring my Advent traditions to a new level and make healthier vegan variations of my favourite cookies. "German Lebkuchen" tastes a bit like Gingerbread and was a favourite with my colleagues when I brought some to the office for tasting.

With the following recipe I had to face the fact, that you won’t find "German Lebkuchengewürz", the ready-to-use mixture of typical spices, in the UK. Instead I grated the spices I could find to a very thin powder and the taste was quite the original that I know. Baking with the pre-mixture makes it just quicker. 

Usually I was creating small Lebkuchen piles on top of wafer, but this time I went for crafting cute cut-out hearts with a biscuit cutter.


### Ingredients

Ingredients to fill approximately two baking trays

#### Dough
* 250g almonds
* 250g hazelnuts + pecan
* ~6 teaspoons egg replacer mixed with water according to directions - to replace 6 eggs)
* 130g half agave, half rice syrup
* 75g candied lemon peel
* 75g candied orange peel
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

#### Spicery
* ½ bag "German Lebkuchengewürz"
OR grind:
* 1 tablespoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon cardamon
* 1 teaspoon clove
* 1 teaspoon mace OR if unavailable use nutmeg


#### To brush:
* some plant based milk (oat OR rice OR soy milk)


#### Choclate-Icing for half the cookies
* 20g cocoa butter
* 20g white almond butter
* 6g cocoa
* 8g agave syrup
* pinch of salt

#### Sugar-Icing for second half
* 40g Xylitol OR cane sugar (grind in blender to become like icing sugar)
* 1 tablespoon warm water (start with less and add if needed)
* 1 teaspoon lemon OR orange juice


#### Decoration
* Almond Flakes


### Let’s start
* Grind / Chop all the nuts very fine e.g. using a food processor.
* Stir egg replacement and sweet syrups together and add the spices. In case the candied peels are quite big those can be chopped before adding them. Mix together with the ground nuts and knead dough.
* Preheat the oven to 170°C.
* *Trick to roll out the dough without sticking: Cut a freezer bag into half and put a small heap of dough between those sheets.* Now use a rolling stick to **flatten to about 1cm**.
* Cut out hearts or what ever cutters you have and love.
* Place the cookies with a little space between them on a baking tray covered with baking paper.
* For extra soft cookies apply plant milk with a knife.
* Bake in the pre-heated oven at **170°C at about 15 minutes**. (check them from time to time to get them out before getting dark). Place a small bowl with water in the oven for extra moisture.
* Mix together the two icings as following or make double the amount of the one of your choice.


### Prepare the choclate-Icing
* Melt the cocoa butter in a double boiler.
* Fold the rest of the ingredients with a whisk.
* Use while liquid. In case it turns too cold to spread, re-heat in the double boiler.


### Prepare the Sugar-Icing
* Stir water into fine sugar and add lemon or orange juice to taste.


### Finish up
Spread icing on the cookies and add almond flakes to the choclate ones.

Let the Lebkuchen cool down on a cooling tray.

Enjoy right away and store the cookies in a food container. Other more traditional recipes turn out quite dry and hard and need apple pieces to be added to the box. My vegan ones turned out lovely and ready to eat right away.
