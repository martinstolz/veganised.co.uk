Grown up in Germany I only knew white asparagus served in the classic combination with potatoes and sauce Hollandaise. Once I discovered how versatile it is I got hooked. 

Green asparagus features a lovely full flavour whilst being less tender which makes it easier to prepare. It is widely common in England opposing to the rest of Europe that traditionally grows white asparagus. But it seems the green stalks become more popular lately in Germany as well.



### Ingredients

Serves 2


#### Pasta

* Egg-free pasta of your choice
* Salted water


#### Creamy white sauce

* Â½ red onion
* 1-2 garlic gloves 
* 1 bunch green asparagus
* 4 button mushrooms
* 1 tbsp cider vinegar
* 3 tbsp oat cream
* Salt and black pepper
* Oil for frying i.e. coconut oil


#### Serving suggestions

* Rocket as a bed
* Top with [Vegan Parmesan]({% post_url 2016-04-08-cheese-parmesan %})

### Preparation

If your chosen pasta has a very short cooking time, for example using fresh one, you should start to prepare the sauce before starting to cook the pasta. Best timing allows to add the pasta directly to the ready sauce. Otherwise pasta can become sticky and cold till ready to serve.

#### Vegetables

0. Dice half a red onion
1. Mince the garlic
2. Wash and trim off the thick end of the asparagus. Cut diagonal in short chunks. Note that green asparagus usually does not require to be peeled!
3. Chop the mushrooms in thin slices

### Let's start

#### Pasta

0. Bring salted water to a boil.
1. Cook pasta according to the timing provided on the packaging.
2. Keep some of the pasta water when done.

#### Vegetables

0. Heat a pan with some oil and fry the onion till starting to brown.
1. Add the garlic and shortly continue to fry.
2. Add a shot of cider vinegar for a balanced tasting white sauce.
2. Deglaze the sauce with oat cream mixed with a little of our pasta water.
3. Set the onions aside and start frying the asparagus till slightly starting to brown. Then add the mushrooms.
4. Once the asparagus and mushrooms turned soft you can combine them with the onions. Add more oat cream for more sauce. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Toss the pasta with the sauce for best spreading


### Assemble

* Optionally start by adding rocket to the plate as bed.
* Add the pasta and top with the vegan parmesan and fresh ground black pepper.

**Enjoy!**
