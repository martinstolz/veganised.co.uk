*Veggie sushi options are often limited to only a few simple rolls.* I do love avocado or cucumber on its own, but there are so many more delicious combinations possible.

Among many vegetables we love to add one ingredient, that probably no traditional Japanese recipe would call for - and that is peanut butter! Trust us it just tastes delicious!

### Preparation


#### The rice

0. First start cooking the rice. Choose the rice base you like. We like to use sushi rice and mix in white quinoa for all its health benefits. Brown rice or a mix work well too.
0. Prepare the other ingredients while the rice is cooking according to its packet instructions on time and water. 
0. Afterwards spread it in a large bowl or on a plate to let it cool down.
0. Stir together the rice vinegar with sugar and salt and fold it into the rice once cooled down.


#### Peanut Coated Tofu

0. Whisk peanut butter together with some soy sauce to get a creamy consistency
0. Press the tofu between kitchen towel sheets to remove some liquid and make it firmer holding together
0. Cut the tofu in thin stripes. Think of the size as to fit into your sushi rolls.
0. Heat a pan with some coconut oil.
0. Coat the tofu with our peanut mixture.
0. Shortly fry the tofu on high heat from two sides
0. Set tofu aside to let cool down


#### Vegetables

0. Best to leave the avocado as last and cut it shortly before you start putting everything together to keep it from turning brown on the air
0. Cut all your chosen vegetables in very thin stripes.
0. Cut the avocado in half, slice it in stripes inside the peel and then spoon it all out


### Assemble
0. Place a nori sheet with the shiny side down on your mat or towel
0. Add a handful of rice and spread it carefully on the nori sheet with your hands. It helps to dip your fingers in water first to avoid too much sticking.
0. Cover the lower 1/3 to 2/3 of your sheet, leaving one centimeter at the bottom edge free.
0. Place your filling ingredients as a thin line across the middle of the rice

**Time to get creative, here some inspiration:**

0. If you like it spicy, start by spreading a tiny line of wasabi across the rice
0. Another nice start is a thin line of peanut butter
0. Next optional is spreading vegan cream cheese over the whole rice
0. Top with sesame seeds.
0. Now add the rest of your chosen ingredients along a line. You can combine them differently in each roll to discover different interesting flavours.
0. Carefully roll everything up (see tips below)
0. Dampen the top edge of the nori sheet with a little water to seal
0. Complete more rolls till you used up your rice


### Serve

0. Take a sharp knife and brush it with rice vinegar or water to prevent sticking
0. Cut into maki pieces 
0. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi and pickled ginger - enjoy!

### Notes

You can keep the uncut rolls for later in an air tight container if you made more then you can eat at once.

This is not a complete recipe with step by step pictures or any measurements yet. Instead it gives you ideas on ingredients to combine. Just see which ones you like and keep in mind what you can get seasonal and organic as much as possible.

If you never made sushi it will help to watch a short video to get a good idea on how to add the ingredients, how much to add per roll and how to roll it up.
