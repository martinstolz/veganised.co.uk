*The festive season is almost here. Along comes the annual question of what to eat for Christmas?* As an answer we present our veganised turn of a classic German Beef Roulade. They are perfect with festive spiced red cabbage and potatoes or potato dumplings.

We have been looking for ideas for a new Christmas Eve dinner tradition since turning vegan. These are so delicious that I have a feeling we will come back to this next year!
