Once upon a day we visited friends in Berlin and they cooked this amazing recipe which normally has dairy as a topping. Probably not a hard task to veganise it, though the recipe was written in German and that's why it finds its way onto this blog.

Sweet potatoes are a great source of vitamin A, B5, B6, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin and also high in carotenoids due to their orange colour. Having a look at one of my favourite [nutrition resources](http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-cancer-potential-of-sweet-potato-proteins/) it looks like sweet potatoes are looking suspiciously good on fighting cancers.
By the way any squash would be fine for this recipe I assume.

2. Cook on medium heat for further 10 minutes and stir every now and then. Add the *peanut butter*{:.ingredient_8} and continue to cook until the *sweet potatoes*{:.ingredient_4} are getting soft and the sauce is creamy. If the chunks were bigger and they are still not soft cook for some more minutes with a lid on. Season again with salt and *cayenne*{:.ingredient_6} to your taste.
