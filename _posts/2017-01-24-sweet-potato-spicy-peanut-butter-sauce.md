Once upon a day we visited friends in Berlin and they cooked this amazing recipe which normally has dairy as a topping. Probably not a hard task to veganise it, though the recipe was written in German and that's why it finds its way onto this blog.

Sweet potatoes are a great source of vitamin A, B5, B6, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin and also high in carotenoids due to their orange colour. Having a look at one of my favourite [nutrition resources](http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-cancer-potential-of-sweet-potato-proteins/) it looks like sweet potatoes are looking suspiciously good on fighting cancers.
By the way any squash would be fine for this recipe I assume.

### Ingredients

Serves about 2

#### Main

* 1 onion
* 1 garlic clove
* 1/2 tbsp sugar, i.e. coconut sugar
* 500g sweet potatoes
* 1 tbsp frying oil, i.e. olive
* 1/2 tsp cayenne and or 1/2 tbsp chilli flakes
* 40g peanut butter
* 400g canned tomatoes

#### Topping

* 1 bunch fresh coriander
* 50g or more plain soya yoghurt or oat cream or even thick coconut milk
* As many salted peanuts as you wish

### Let's start

Let's start, in 45 minutes you should have the tastiest sweet potato dish in your mouth.

0. Peel and dice the onion and garlic. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them in to max 2cm by 2cm chunks, faster cooking time with half of the size
1. Fry the onion and garlic for up to 2 minutes. Add the sweet potato chunks. While stirring fry for further 10 minutes. Season with sugar, salt and cayenne. Stir well to distribute the spice. Now add the tomatoes and chop them if needed.
2. Cook on medium heat for further 10 minutes and stir every now and then. Add the peanut butter and continue to cook until the sweet potatoes are getting soft and the sauce is creamy. If the chunks were bigger and they are still not soft cook for some more minutes with a lid on. Season again with salt and cayenne to your taste.

#### Assemble

0. Coarsely chop the roasted peanuts and the coriander.
1. Take a bowl or plate or anything you like add the sweet potatoes with sauce and add a tablespoon or two of the soya yoghurt or alternative. Sprinkle the roasted peanuts and chilli flakes and coriander.
