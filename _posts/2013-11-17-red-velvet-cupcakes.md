### Ingredients

The following turns into 12 cupcakes.
#### Cupcakes – Dry ingredients
* 60g coconut flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 30g raw cocoa powder
* 80g Xylitol (Or use Stevia, crane sugar or other preferred sweetener)
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* ¼ teaspoon salt

#### Wet ingredients
* ~4 tablespoons egg replacer mixed with water according to directions (to replace 8 egg whites)
* beetroot juice
* 2 mashed ripe bananas

#### Vanilla cream topping
* 1 Container Tofutti Better Than Cream Cheese
* Fresh lime juice (or use lemon)
* 1 Teaspoon vanilla extract
* Agave syrup or other sweetener
* Decoration: dried goji berries


### Let’s start
Preheat your oven to 180°C and prepare a muffin tray with paper cups.
Mix all the dried ingredients in a big bowl. Add the egg mixture of choice and stir well together.

Slowly mix in the beetroot juice (or red food colouring). Add as much as to give the mixture a nice colour. Notice that some of the colour will vanish while baking.

Mash the bananas and stir into the bowl. Keep some small chunks if you like to accent the banana flavour. Or use a mixer to get a flat batter.

Fill the batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups and bake in the oven at **180°C 20-25 min**. Ready when a needle (e.g. a toothpick) remains dry after dipping it in the middle of a cake. Leave alone till cooled down.

### While baking – prepare the Topping
Stir cream cheese and slowly add other ingredients. Season to own taste. Keep cool in the fridge or even freezer till cakes are cooled down and ready to be topped.

### Finish up
Gently place the topping on the cake and while rotating the base, spread the topping even as a pretty cup. I topped mine with some dried goji berries for an additional health kick and because the colour matches up with that of the cake.

My topping was a little too sour. I added the juice of half a lime. So my tip: add the juice slowly and taste to adjust. Maybe next time I’ll try a lemon.
